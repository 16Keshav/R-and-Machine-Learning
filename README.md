# R-and-Machine-Learning
This is a dir that anyone can view the code about R and as you can see clearly,it is all about Machine Learning.The reason I want to say sorry is that I have been learning ML for just a couple of days,so I am totally a fresh man.

## Algorithms in this repository
* Support Vector Machine
* Decision Tree(including random forest,C5.0,rpart)
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic regression
* Linear regression
* Artificial Neural Networks
* K Nearest Neighbor
* K-means
* Association Rules

## ggplot2 coming up


Hope for more valid advice from the experienced experts

Thank you so much
